Blind and visually impaired users [edit]

In 1974, Ray Kurzweil started the company Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc. and continued development of omni-font OCR, which could recognize text printed
in virtually any font (Kurzweil is often credited with inventing omni-font OCR, but it was in use by companies, including Compuscan, in the late 1960s and
1970s!31l61), Kurzweil decided that the best application of this technology would be to create a reading machine for the blind, which would allow blind people to
have a computer read text to them out loud. This device required the invention of two enabling technologies - the CCD flatbed scanner and the text-to-speech
synthesizer. On January 13, 1976, the successful finished product was unveiled during a widely reported news conference headed by Kurzweil and the leaders of
the National Federation of the Blind.{<itation needed! jn 1978, Kurzweil Computer Products began selling a commercial version of the optical character recognition
â€˜computer program. LexisNexis was one of the first customers, and bought the program to upload legal paper and news documents onto its nascent online
databases. Two years later, Kurzweil sold his company to Xerox, which had an interest in further commercializing paper-to-computer text conversion. Xerox
eventually spun it off as Scansoft, which merged with Nuance Communications.

In the 2000s, OCR was made available online as a service (WebOCR), in a cloud computing environment, and in mobile applications like real-time translation of
foreign-language signs on a smartphone. With the advent of smart-phones and smartglasses, OCR can be used in internet connected mobile device applications
that extract text captured using the device's camera. These devices that do not have OCR functionality built into the operating system will typically use an OCR
API to extract the text from the image file captured and provided by the device.I7II81 The OCR API returns the extracted text, along with information about the
location of the detected text in the original image back to the device app for further processing (such as text-to-speech) or display.

Various commercial and open source OCR systems are available for most common writing systems, including Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, Hebrew, Indic, Bengali
(Bangla), Devanagari, Tamil, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters.
